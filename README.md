# Programming Languages Search Trend Analysis

## Project Overview

In this project, I performed a search trend analysis to explore the popularity of five major programming languages—**Python, Rust, C++, Java, and JavaScript**—over the past five years. Using data extracted from **Google Trends**, I visualized the data with **Matplotlib** and **Pandas** to uncover valuable insights into the rise and fall of interest in these programming languages.

## Tools & Libraries

- **Pytrends**: To interface with the Google Trends API and retrieve search interest data for the programming languages.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing the search trends in the form of line graphs and bar charts.

## Installation Guide

1. Set up your environment:
   ```bash
   conda create -n trend_analysis python=3.9
   conda activate trend_analysis
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   conda install -c conda-forge pytrends pandas matplotlib
   ```


## Data Source

The dataset was collected using the **Pytrends** library, which connects to Google Trends and retrieves search interest data for each programming language over the past five years.

## Key Insights

- **Python** has consistently been the most popular language among the five.
- **Rust** has shown steady growth, reflecting the increasing interest in system-level programming languages.
- **Java** and **C++** have remained relatively stable in popularity but are slightly declining.
- **JavaScript** continues to show high search interest due to its dominance in web development.

## Visualizations

The following visualizations were created to represent the trends:

- **Line Graphs**: Show the search interest over time for each programming language.
- **Bar Charts**: Compare the overall popularity between the languages during specific periods.

## Future Work

This project marks the beginning of my journey into **Big Data Analytics**. I plan to continue exploring similar projects and expand my knowledge in:

- Analyzing larger datasets.
- Applying machine learning to predict future trends.
- Enhancing data visualizations with interactive dashboards (using tools like **Tableau**, **PowerBi** or **Plotly**).

## Conclusion

This analysis provides useful insights into the evolving trends in programming language popularity. As I continue my journey into **Big Data Analytics**, this project lays the groundwork for more advanced data analysis projects in the future.
